Here are a couple of example sentences using SSH:

1. **"I connected to my server at work using SSH this morning."**
   This sentence means you used the Secure Shell protocol to remotely connect to your server.

2. **"Before I could run any commands, I had to enter my SSH key."**
   In this context, an SSH key is a form of authentication used with SSH. You entered it before you were allowed to perform any actions on the remote computer.

3. **"To install software on my remote Linux server, I use SSH and then employ the 'sudo' command."**
   This sentence shows how SSH is used to connect to a remote Linux server, and then other commands (like 'sudo') are used to execute tasks.
