1. **Definition**:
   - A sentence is a set of words that makes sense and expresses a complete thought.
   - Example: "The cat sat on the mat" is an example of a simple sentence.

2. **Writing or Forming Sentences**:
   - I can write a sentence about my pet dog.
   - She struggled to form a coherent sentence during her presentation.

3. **Sentence Structure**:
   - The basic structure of a sentence is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).
   - Example: "She (S) ate (V) the pizza (O)."

4. **Complex Sentences**:
   - A complex sentence contains at least two clauses.
   - Example: "When I went to the store, it was raining heavily."

5. **Sentence Diagramming or Parsing**:
   - In grammar classes, we often diagram sentences to understand their structure better.

6. **Sentence Fragment**:
   - A sentence fragment is not a complete sentence because it lacks either a subject or a verb.
   - Example: "Running fast." (This is not a complete sentence because it lacks a subject.)

7. **Incomplete Sentences**:
   - Comma splices occur when two sentences are joined by a comma without a coordinating conjunction.
   - Example: "I went to the store, I bought some apples."

8. **Sentence Variety**:
   - Using a variety of sentence structures makes your writing more interesting.
   - Example: Instead of starting every sentence with "She," use different sentence openings like "In her room," "One day," etc.

9. **Sentence Length**:
   - Very short sentences can be used for emphasis, while long sentences can provide detailed explanations.
   - Example: Short sentence - "Stop!" Long sentence - "After thinking about it for a long time, I finally decided to go for the job interview."

10. **Sentence as a Unit of Meaning**:
    - In English, a sentence is the basic unit of meaning and grammatical organization.
    - Example: "I'm going to the store" expresses one complete thought.
