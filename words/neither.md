1. **When neither applies to two options:**
   - Neither of the movies was interesting. (This means both movies were boring.)
   - Neither of the books had good endings. (Both books had bad endings.)
   - Neither plan seems feasible at the moment. (Neither plan is possible right now.)

2. **When neither applies to two people or groups:**
   - Neither of my friends wanted to go to the party. (This means both friends didn't want to attend the party.)
   - Neither team scored a goal during the match. (Both teams failed to score.)
   - Neither of us knows where the library is. (This means neither you nor me knows the location.)

3. **With 'neither...nor':**
   - Neither John nor Mary likes pizza. (John doesn't like pizza and Mary also doesn't like pizza.)
   - Neither here nor there: It doesn't matter where you put it. (It's equally indifferent whether you put something here or there.)
   - Neither you nor I can solve this problem alone. (Both of us can't solve the problem by ourselves.)

4. **With 'not either':**
   - Not either/or is an option: This means that neither of the two options are suitable choices.

5. **With 'neither...nor' to contrast:**
   - Neither a borrower nor a lender be: This means you shouldn't borrow money from others or lend your money to others, as it can cause problems in relationships.
   - Neither rain nor snow will keep me from coming to the meeting: This means that no matter how bad the weather is (rain or snow), I'll still come to the meeting.
